# MediQal (Team22)

Our solution applies uses quantum annealing to solve Traveling Salesperson Problems to efficiently route mobile healthcare vehicles. We utilize both classical and quantum solvers for this task. Our quantum solutions are obtained by submitting QUBO problems to the DWave quantum annealers via Amazon Braket.
